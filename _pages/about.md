Welcome! I am a data scientist working at KenterGroendus. Here, I develop Machine Learning models which help companies getting sustainable and accurate energy measurements. 

Currently, I am also working on the publication of my thesis and planning the defense of my PhD. For my PhD research, I studied language and communication in the brains of neurotypical, autistic and socially anxious individuals at the Donders Institute in the [Mutual Understanding lab](https://www.mutualunderstanding.nl) with [Jana Bašnáková](https://www.ru.nl/personen/basnakova-j) and [Arjen Stolk](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vkOO60EAAAAJ&hl=en), and the [Neurobiology of Language lab](https://www.mpi.nl/department/neurobiology-language/4/people) with [Peter Hagoort](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Idye6Q0AAAAJ&hl=en).
