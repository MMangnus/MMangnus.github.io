Welcome! I am a data-oriented scientist with a background in studying language, communication, and Theory of Mind in the brains of neurotypical, autistic and socially anxious individuals. Currently, I am working on the publication of my thesis and planning the defense of my PhD at the Donders Institute at the [Mutual Understanding lab](https://www.mutualunderstanding.nl) with [Jana Bašnáková](https://www.ru.nl/personen/basnakova-j) and [Arjen Stolk](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vkOO60EAAAAJ&hl=en), and the [Neurobiology of Language lab](https://www.mpi.nl/department/neurobiology-language/4/people) with [Peter Hagoort](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Idye6Q0AAAAJ&hl=en). 

I am also on the job market, interested in positions in industry focused on data science and data analysis. Feel free to check out my [CV](/cv/) or [contact me](mailto:mangnusm+contactwebsite@gmail.com) if you're interested in collaborating.
